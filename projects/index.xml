      <description>One day, the plastic housing that held my friend&amp;rsquo;s key fob together broke.
  Key - Exploded View     Key - Exploded View    The plastic shell had two halves. One was connected to the metal on the key, and the other snapped onto it. Inside the shell were the electronics responsible for locking/unlocking doors and allowing the car to start. Some tabs on the plastic shell had broken off, so the case couldn&amp;rsquo;t snap together anymore.</description>

      <description>Everybody loves RGB LEDs. There isn&amp;rsquo;t a single thing that couldn&amp;rsquo;t benefit from having more LEDS. I remember watching a tv show as a child where a guitar player had LED lights on their amplifier that reacted to the music. That idea stuck with me, and when I first got a synthesizer I decided to try accomplishing something similar. I wanted something colorful and fully customizable, that could be programmed to react to music.</description>

      <description>In college I became interested in learning how to weave. My first loom was a model known as an Inkle Loom that my dad and I built using lumber and wooden dowels. It produced straps no wider than 4&amp;rdquo;, that were durable and well-suited for guitars, cameras, and belts. This was an excellent beginner loom that taught me many of the fundamentals of the craft. Eventually, though, I wanted to start weaving wider fabrics.</description>
