<p>In college I became interested in learning how to weave. My first loom was a model known as an Inkle Loom that my dad and I built using lumber and wooden dowels. It produced straps no wider than 4&rdquo;, that were durable and well-suited for guitars, cameras, and belts. This was an excellent beginner loom that taught me many of the fundamentals of the craft.  Eventually, though, I wanted to start weaving wider fabrics.</p>
<p>When I bought a 3D printer, one of my first projects was to design a wider loom.  After seeing similar looms online and in stores, I had a basic idea of what I would be making. The new design would be a “rigid-heddle” loom. These looms are simple and effective at quickly producing fabrics around 12&rdquo; wide.</p>

<div id=Design&#32;Considerations class="section-title has-background-lighter"><h3>Design Considerations</h3></div>
<p>Some of the qualities that I wanted the loom to have were:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Sturdy</td>
<td>the frame remains rigid and square while withstanding the various forces</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Versatile</td>
<td>Able to weave a wide variety of fabrics</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adjustable</td>
<td>Able to adjust the frame dimensions for different heddles/widths</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Modifiable</td>
<td>Each part needs to be easily replaced</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Modular</td>
<td>Each part should function independently of the others</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lightweight</td>
<td>Uses a minimal amount of material</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Many of the parts were going to be 3D printed, but printing the whole assembly wouldn&rsquo;t be time or money efficient. To reduce the cost of filament, I opted for some hardware. The frame is made of wooden dowels and 3D printed corner assemblies. The dowels were chosen for their low cost, smoothness, and availability at hardware stores.</p>
<p><div id=Loom&#32;Design class="section-title has-background-lighter"><h3>Loom Design</h3></div>
<div class="subsection-title"><h4>Frame</h4></div></p>
<p>The design process began with creating the loom&rsquo;s rectangular frame.  Each side of the loom is made of two dowel rods (called the frame dowels) held in place by 3D printed corner brackets.

<p>To make the frame size adjustable, the frame dowels are clamped into place rather than glued. The width of the loom is easily adjusted by loosening the clamp and sliding the dowels to the desired position.</p>
<p>To make the corners more easily printable, they were split into two pieces. They are held together by bolts on the corner. The bolts enter through the circular holes, while a hexagonal counter-bore houses the nut on the other side. This was done to simplify the assembly. The dowel clamps are tightened using bolts, which are likewise counter-bored on the back side.</p>

<div class="subsection-title"><h4>Weaving Mechanism</h4></div>
<p>With a frame in place, the next step was to mount the weaving mechanism.  In a nutshell, here&rsquo;s how the weaving mechanism works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two spools (<em>warp spools</em>) are located at opposite ends of the frame
<ul>
<li>One spool holds un-woven thread, and the other holds the fabric after it&rsquo;s woven</li>
<li>The thread on these spools is called the <em>warp thread</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fabric is woven by passing a thread perpendicularly through the warp threads
<ul>
<li>the thread passed through is called the <em>weft thread</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>heddle</strong> is an essential component to weaving quickly
<ul>
<li>it raises every other warp thread to create a gap (or, a &ldquo;shed&rdquo;)</li>
<li>the weft thread is passed through the shed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As fabric is woven, the spools are adjusted to move the working area along</li>
</ul>
<p>The warp spools are wound on 1-in. dowels, and are centered with respect to the frame. While weaving, they need to be held to prevent the warp threads from moving around and losing tension. Bolts on both sides of the warp spool tighten to clamp down the warp spools. Threaded inserts are used to provide tension on the clamp. The clamp is lined with sandpaper to provide additional friction.</p>
<p>The heightened dowels are called apron rods. They create a planar surface parallel to the ground, on which the weaving is done. This serves a couple of purposes. First, the apron rods provide additional friction which helps to maintain the warp tension. Next, it allows the heddle to be moved with more clearance. If the heddle weren&rsquo;t raised, it would hit the ground below the loom. Using apron rods creates a helpful empty space underneath the working area.</p>

        <a onclick=open_modal(&#34;loom3&#34;)> 
            <img class="article-pic" src=/images/loom/loom3.jpg alt=""> 
        </a>
        <figcaption class="has-text-link has-background-light">Apron Rods and the Shed</figcaption>
    </figure>




<div id=loom3 class="modal">
    <div class="modal-background" onclick=close_modal(&#34;loom3&#34;)></div>
    <div class="modal-content">
        <img class="figure full-pic" src=/images/loom/loom3.jpg alt="">
        <div class="caption has-text-info">Apron Rods and the Shed</div>
    </div>
    <button class="modal-close is-large" aria-label="close" onclick=close_modal(&#34;loom3&#34;)></button>
</div>
<p>The heddle rests on <strong>heddle mounts</strong> which hold it in a raised or lowered position. The mounts are able to slide along the frame dowels. It’s easiest to pass the shuttle through the shed created immediately below the heddle. Allowing the heddle mounts to slide closer to the weaver is convenient. Moving the heddle further from the weaver increases the working area, which allows more weaving without needing to wind the warp dowels as often.</p>
<div id=Results class="section-title has-background-lighter"><h3>Results</h3></div>
<p>The loom design is successful, and meets all of the criteria described in the table above.  The frame is rigid, the warp dowels clamp down easily, and the heddle moves easily back and forth. I left the dowels as long as possible, in case I wanted to adjust the frame size in the future. They could easily be trimmed flush with the corners to give the loom a more &ldquo;finished&rdquo; look.</p>
<p>The woven fabric is thinner than the straps woven on the inkle loom.  One neat thing is that, while the inkle loom straps only show the warp threads, the fabric from this loom shows warp and weft threads to create a grid.  The fabric below was produced on the loom:</p>

I would like my next loom to include more advanced features such as multiple heddles. This loom is good for producing simple weaves, but isn’t suited for producing complex patterns. Another project for another day… 🙂</p>
